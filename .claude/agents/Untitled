Please help me create an application which we'll use as a back-end. Let's see. We'll use Next.js React and Python to allow people to conversate with an LLM. It will allow them to also use some external functionalities, in particular, like gathering feedback and giving thumbs up/tumbs down in terms of the responses got by the agent. In this project, there will be a config file that will allow the usage for different customers of slightly different solutions. The database will be set up on Subabase, the deployment will be on Verso. Do you hear me?
